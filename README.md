<h1>Git. Stage 0</h1>
Hi, kottans! /* (no, I'm not an Englishman, just pretending) */ The Git course on Udacity took me much more time than I expected. But I'm not upset, cause it was really useful and not boring at all.  

<h2>1. Udacity course on Git</h2>
Git wasn't easy. I've created a lot of sticky notes to ease my suffering (guess I'll need them in the future). So you can use them too.

<h2>2. Learngitbranching.js</h2>
Learngitbranching was really horrible for me. The app was meant to be simple. But actually is wasn't. Two points for its developers (and zero for me).

<h2>3. Learn typing.js</h2>
I liked Typing Club website a lot, so I sticked there for some time.

<h2>4. Gi-it</h2>
Gi-it is my favourite tool to aquire Git. This is a simple guide for Git newcomers. Plus it's available in Ukrainian.

<h2>5. Articles</h2>
'Git for 30 minute' was much more useful for me than the whole Learninbraching website. It was simple and not so messy. 
Another 5 points from me goes to 'How to Cope with Negative Thoughts'. Kind of motivation article which would be useful for everyone at the start of the long way to expertise.

So here is my advice - keep calm and get ready for new challenges!

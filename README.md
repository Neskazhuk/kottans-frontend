# General
Hi, kottans! :upside_down_face: *(no, I'm not an Englishman, just pretending)*

Since the war started I've decided to change my careÐµr. Here you can see how I cope with it, slowly but surely going forward (as you do). 
> So get your fingers ready, and let's make some :fire:

I finally understood that this site above is too much for me. 

Instead I liked [Brian Yu's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJUJ4wbFm_A&ab_channel=CS50) (*you can also find it in additional materials*). He uses simple examples explaining how Git works. That's why it's so simple and clear. Plus it takes only 40 minutes. So that you don't need these huge courses - just watch this one video instead.

Yet I highly recommend ['Oh, shit Git!'](https://ohshitgit.com/#magic-time-machine) website ! It's fun and useful.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
<details><summary>Linux like a pro</summary>

**Frankly saying**, I don't understand why we dive in so deeply inside this. It seems to me that we can do the same in SourceTree with much more less effords. Hope I'll use all of this one time. 

I have already known some commands after working with Git Bush. So the first part of this course was quite easy for me. But the second one was hard. And hosetly it seemed to me simply unuseful.

## Git Basics
<details><summary>Udacity course, Git-it, Learn Typing and more</summary> 

### 1. Udacity course on Git
Git wasn't easy. It took me much more time than I expected. But I'm not upset, cause it was really useful and not boring at all. I've created a lot of sticky notes to ease my suffering (guess I'll need them in the future). So you can use them too.

### 2. Learngitbranching.js
Learngitbranching was really horrible for me. The app was meant to be simple. But actually is wasn't. Two points for its developers (and zero for me).

### 3. Learn typing.js
I liked Typing Club website a lot, so I sticked there for some time.

### 4. Git-it
Git-it is my favourite tool to aquire Git. This is a simple guide for Git newcomers. Plus it's available in Ukrainian.

### 5. Articles
'Git for 30 minute' was much more useful for me than the whole Learninbraching website. It was simple and not so messy. 
Another 5 points from me goes to 'How to Cope with Negative Thoughts'. Kind of motivation article which would be useful for everyone at the start of the long way to expertise.

So here is my advice - keep calm and get ready for new challenges!
